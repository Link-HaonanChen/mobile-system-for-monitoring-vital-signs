# KE.Net ECG

KE.Net ECG is an Android application that implements getting an ECG from a Polar H10 heart monitor. The H10 needs to have firmware version 3.0.35 or later installed, and you need to know the ID of your device (which is printed on its side).  You can see the ECG trace in real time and save PNG and CSV files of the data.

It uses the Polar SDK located at  https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk.
