   - focus on collecting data for wearable equipment

   - collecting data focusing on heart rate, brain wave, blood sugar, blood pressure, sleep quality (pregnant women)

     

3.  **Techs supports: Good at electrical and computing, facial recognition**

    

4.  **Using current data to develop a simulator (divided team into 2 groups: one for developing simulator, another for developing software)**

    

5.  **Our task in this project: To develop a software to monitor human body status (only planning for android version now), using data from experiments and relevant equipment.**
